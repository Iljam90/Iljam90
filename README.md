## Overview

OBLAEX is a modular, simulation-first ecosystem combining reinforcement-learning AI with high-fidelity virtual physiology.  
It is designed for **research and prototyping only** — **no real-world hardware or clinical application** is executed in this repository.  

Key features:  

- **OBLAEXCore**: RL coordinator, experiment manager, logging, checkpointing.  
- **VirtualHeart**: Physiological simulation engine producing timed feedback signals (HRV, biomarkers, immune surrogates).  
- **Lucky Cell / Immuno Pacemaker**: Virtual adaptive cell models via frequency-based stimulation.  
- **VirtualEyes**: Multimodal perception (vision + speech sentiment analysis).  
- **OBLAEXBrain**: Emergent decision layer, fusing signals to produce high-level strategies.  
- **OBLAEXAlphabet**: Encodes bio-signals into math/geometric vectors for AI agents.
